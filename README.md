# chart-verifier

`chart-verifier` is a tool that validates a Helm chart against a configurable list of checks; individual checks can be
included or excluded through command line options. The default set of tests covers Red Hatâ€™s recommendations.

Each check is independent and execution order is not guaranteed. Input is provided through options in
the command line interface; currently the only input is the required `uri` option.

The following checks have been implemented:

| Name | Description
|---|---
| `is-helm-v3` | Checks whether the given `uri` is a Helm v3 chart.
| `has-readme` | Checks whether the Helm chart contains a `README.md` file.
| `contains-test` | Checks whether the Helm chart contains at least one test file.
| `has-minkubeversion` | Checks whether the Helm chart's `Chart.yaml` includes the `minKubeVersion` field.
| `readme-contains-values-schema` | Checks whether the Helm chart `README.md` file contains a `values` schema section.
| `not-contains-crds` | Check whether the Helm chart does not include CRDs.

The following checks are being implemented and/or considered:

| Name | Description
|---|---
| `keywords-are-openshift-categories` | Checks whether the Helm chart's `Chart.yaml` file includes keywords mapped to OpenShift categories.
| `is-commercial-chart` | Checks whether the Helm chart is a Commercial chart.
| `is-community-chart` | Checks whether the Helm chart is a Community chart.
| `not-contains-infra-plugins-and-drivers` | Check whether the Helm chart does not include infra plugins and drivers (network, storage, hardware, etc)
| `can-be-installed-without-manual-prerequisites` |
| `can-be-installed-without-cluster-admin-privileges` |

## Architecture

This tool inspects a Helm
chart URI (`file://`, `https?://`, etc)
and returns either a *positive* result indicating the Helm chart has passed all checks, or a *negative* result indicating
which checks have failed and remedial actions.

The application is separated in two pieces: a command line interface and a library. This is handy because the command
line interface is specific to the user interface, and the library can be generic enough to be used to, for example,
inspect Helm chart bytes in flight.

One positive aspect of the command line interface specificity is that its output can be tailored to the methods of
consumption the user expects; in other words, the command line interface can be programmed in such way it can be
represented as either *YAML* or *JSON* formats, in addition to a descriptive representation tailored to human actors.

Primitive functions to manipulate the Helm chart should be provided, since most checks involve inspecting the contents
of the chart itself; for example, whether a `README.md` file exists, or whether `README.md` contains the `values`'
specification, implicating in offering a cache API layer is required to avoid downloading and unpacking the charts for
each test.

```

The container image created by the build program is tagged with the commit ID of the working directory at the time of
the build: `quay.io/redhat-certification/chart-verifier:07e369d`. In this example `07e369d` is the commit-id which may change.

## Usage

### Local Usage

To certify a chart against all available checks:

```text
> out/chart-verifier certify ./chart.tgz
> out/chart-verifier certify ~/src/chart
> out/chart-verifier certify https://www.example.com/chart.tgz
```

To apply only the `is-helm-v3` check:

```text
> chart-verifier certify --enable is-helm-v3 https://www.example.com/chart.tgz
```

To apply all checks except `is-helm-v3`:

```text
> chart-verifier certify --disable is-helm-v3 https://www.example.com/chart.tgz
```

### Container Usage

The container image produced in 'Building chart-verifier' can then be executed with the Docker client
as `docker run -it --rm quay.io/redhat-certification/chart-verifier:07e369d certify`.

If you haven't built a container image, you could still use the Docker client to execute the latest release available in
Quay:

```text
> docker run -it --rm quay.io/redhat-certification/chart-verifier:latest verify --help
Certifies a Helm chart by checking some of its characteristics

Usage:
  chart-verifier certify <chart-uri> [flags]

Flags:
  -x, --disable strings   all checks will be enabled except the informed ones
  -e, --enable strings    only the informed checks will be enabled
  -h, --help              help for verify
  -o, --output string     the output format: default, json or yaml

Global Flags:
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.chart-verifier.yaml)
```

To verify a chart on the host system, the directory containing the chart should be mounted in the container; for http or
https verifications, no mounting is required:

```text
> docker run -it --rm quay.io/redhat-certification/chart-verifier:latest verify https://github.com/redhat-certification/chart-verifier/blob/main/pkg/chartverifier/checks/chart-0.1.0-v3.valid.tgz?raw=true

```
