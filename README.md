# Chart Verifier

`chart-verifier` is a tool that verifies a Helm chart is compliant against a configurable list of checks. 

This tool can be used to help ensuring the quality of Helm Charts, from its associated metadatas, formating and readiness for distribution. Additionnaly, it also helps ensuring the Helm Chart will work seamlessly on Red Hat OpenShift and can be submitted as a certified Helm Chart in the [Red Hat Helm Repository](https://github.com/openshift-helm-charts).

## Features

- Helm Chart Verification: Verifies an Helm Chart is compliant with a certain set of checks.
- Red Hat Certified Chart Validation: Verifies an Helm Chart's readiness for being certified and submitted in [Red Hat Helm Repository](https://github.com/openshift-helm-charts).
- Report Generation: Generates a verification report in YAML format.
- Optionable Checks: Defines the checks you want to execute during the verification process.

## Existing Checks

The following checks have been implemented:

| Check | Description
|---|---
| `is-helm-v3` | Checks whether the given `uri` is a Helm v3 chart.
| `has-readme` | Checks whether the Helm chart contains a `README.md` file.
| `contains-test` | Checks whether the Helm chart contains at least one test file.
| `has-minkubeversion` | Checks whether the Helm chart's `Chart.yaml` includes the `minKubeVersion` field.
| `contains-values-schema` | Checks whether the Helm chart contains a values schema.
| `not-contains-crds` | Checks whether the Helm chart does not include CRDs.
| `not-contain-csi-objects` | Checks whether the Helm chart does not include CSI objects.
| `images-are-certified` | Checks whether images referenced by the helm chart are Red Hat certified images.  
| `helm-lint` | Runs the helm lint command to check that the chart is wel formed.
| `contains-values` | Checks whether the Helm chart contains a values file.

Further the checks include installing the chart on an available cluster and running the chart tests. Information on this 
will be provided when this functionality will be added.

## Usage

### Pre Requisities

- Docker installed.
- Internet Connection: The check that images are Red Hat Certified requires an internet connection.  
- Github Id: To submit a chart to the Red Hat Repository.

### Know before you start

- Individual checks can be included or excluded through command line options. 
- The default set of tests covers Red Hatâ€™s submission requirements.
- Each check is independent and execution order is not guaranteed. 

### Basic Usage with Docker

1. To run all checks for a chart available using a uri: 
   ```
   docker run -it --rm quay.io/redhat-certification/chart-verifier verify <chart-uri>
   ```
1. For a chart available locally on disk, from the same directory as the chart: 
   ```
   docker run -v $(pwd):/charts --rm quay.io/redhat-certification/chart-verifier verify /charts/<chart>
   ``` 
1. To get a list of option for the verify request:
   ```
   docker run -it --rm quay.io/redhat-certification/chart-verifier verify help
   ```
   This will produce the following output:
   ```
   Verifies a Helm chart by checking some of its characteristics

   Usage:
     chart-verifier verify <chart-uri> [flags]

   Flags:
      -S, --chart-set strings          set values for the chart (can specify multiple or separate values with commas: key1=val1,key2=val2)
      -F, --chart-set-file strings     set values from respective files specified via the command line (can specify multiple or separate values with commas: key1=path1,key2=path2)
      -X, --chart-set-string strings   set STRING values for the chart (can specify multiple or separate values with commas: key1=val1,key2=val2)
      -f, --chart-values strings       specify values in a YAML file or a URL (can specify multiple)
      -x, --disable strings            all checks will be enabled except the informed ones
      -e, --enable strings             only the informed checks will be enabled
      -h, --help                       help for verify
      -o, --output string              the output format: default, json or yaml
      -s, --set strings                overrides a configuration, e.g: dummy.ok=false

    Global Flags:
          --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.chart-verifier.yaml)
   ```

### Examples 

1. Run a subset of checks:
   ```
   chart-verifier verify -e images-are-certified,helm-lint
   ```
1. Run all checks except a subset:
   ```
   chart-verifier verify -x images-are-certified,helm-lint
   ```
1. Provide chart override values:   
   ```
   chart-verifier verify -S default.port=8080 images-are-certified,helm-lint
   ```
1. Provide chart override values in a file:  
   ```
   chart-verifier verify -F overrides.yaml images-are-certified,helm-lint
   ```
   
### Notes on usage

The checks performed include running ```helm lint```, and ```helm template```(for red hat image certification) against 
the chart. As a result if the chart requires additional values for these to succeed the values must be specified using 
the options available. These options are similar to those use by ```helm lint``` and ```helm template```.

Note, for ``helm lint`` the check will pass if there are no error messages - warning and info messages do not cause the check to fail.


## Submitting a Chart for inclusion in Red Hat Helm Repository and Certification

### Repository

[Red Hat Helm Repository](https://github.com/openshift-helm-charts) is accessible on GitHub:
- [Red Hat Helm Repository](https://github.com/openshift-helm-charts/repo)

### Available Options

| Option | Description
|---|---
| **1. Helm Chart Tarball** | Submit your Chart with its tarball (`chart-verifier`'s report optional).
| **2. Helm Chart extracted Tarball** | Submit your Chart with its extracted tarball (`chart-verifier`'s report optional).
| **3. chart-verifier Report only** | When your Chart will not be hosted in the Red Hat Helm repository, you can just submit the generated report from `chart-verifier` tool.


### Preparing to submit 

1. Complete partner registration for each chart. This result in a file being created in the Red Hat helm repository
   ```
   chart/partners/<partner-name>/<chart-name>/OWNERS
   ```
1. Clone Red Hat Helm Repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/openshift-helm-charts/repo.git
   ```
1. Create a fork of the Red Hat Helm Repository, and create a [git triangle workflow](https://gist.github.com/anjohnson/8994c95ab2a06f7d2339).
1. Add a directory for the version of the chart you will be submitting
   ```
   chart/partners/<partner-name>/<chart-name>/<chart-version>
   ```
   Note: the name and version in the chart must match this directory structure.

### Option1: Submitting Helm Chart as a Tarball

1. Add the tarball to the directory created above:
   ```chart/partners/<partner-name>/<chart-name>/<chart-version>/<Chart>.tgz```
   Note: the chart name and version in the chart must match the directory structure.
2. If you are also including a chart verifier report, from the same directory run:
   ```
   docker run -v $(pwd):/charts --rm quay.io/redhat-certification/chart-verifier verify /charts/<chart>.tgz 2>report.yaml
   ```
   This creates the report: ```chart/partners/<partner-name>/<chart-name>/<chart-version>/report.yaml```
   You should check its content to ensure all checks have passed.

### Option2: Submitting Helm Chart extracted Tarball

1. Add the extracted tarball to the directory in created above:
   ```chart/partners/<partner-name>/<chart-name>/<chart-version>/src/<extracted-tarball>```
   Note: the chart name and version in the chart must match the directory structure.
1. If you are also including a chart verifier report, from the same directory run:
   ```
   docker run -v $(pwd):/charts --rm quay.io/redhat-certification/chart-verifier verify /charts/src 2>report.yaml
   ```
   This creates the report:
   ```chart/partners/<partner-name>/<chart-name>/<chart-version>/report.yaml```
   You should check its content to ensure all checks have passed.

### Option3: Submitting with only `chart-verifier` report

1. From the directory created above generate a verifier report for the chart:  
   ```
   docker run -it --rm quay.io/redhat-certification/chart-verifier verify <chart-uri> 2>report.yaml
   ```
   This creates the report:
   ```chart/partners/<partner-name>/<chart-name>/<chart-version>/report.yaml```
   You should check its content to ensure all checks have passed.
   
### All options
1. Create a branch, commit the files created and push to your personal fork.
1. To test the branch against the submission checks, create a pull request to merge your branch into your personal fork.
1. When ready to submit create a pull request to merge the branch into the Red Hat repository.


### Notes

If a report is not included it will be generated as part of the submission process. 

When a Chart is submitted a series of checks will be run against the associated Pull Request. The PR will fail
and an exception process will be started if the report contains one or more failures or is missing any mandatory 
tests. For more information on the submission process see: https://github.com/openshift-helm-charts/repo.

If the report is to be submitted without a chart, the report should be run against the chart in its final 
location. This is because the verifier will record the chart-uri specified when the report was run and, 
in the absence of a submitted chart, this uri will be used for publication.

If the report is submitted with a chart it must be run against the chart as submitted. So, for example, if submitting 
a tarball, run the report against the tarball that will be submitted. This is important because the report will calculate 
and record a sha256 value for the chart. The submission process will then re-generate the sha256 value and the process 
will fail if the sha values do not match.

If a successful run of the report requires additional values to be specified the report must be submitted with the chart.
This is because the submission process does not have access to the values and the report generated would inevitably include
failures.

## Suggestions

If you have any suggestions for improving the verifier, for example additional checks to add, please open 
an issue in this repository.

# A deeper dive for developers 

## Architecture

This tool inspects a Helm
chart URI (`file://`, `https?://`, etc)
and returns either a *positive* result indicating the Helm chart has passed all checks, or a *negative* result indicating
which checks have failed and remedial actions.

The application is separated in two pieces: a command line interface and a library. This is handy because the command
line interface is specific to the user interface, and the library can be generic enough to be used to, for example,
inspect Helm chart bytes in flight.

One positive aspect of the command line interface specificity is that its output can be tailored to the methods of
consumption the user expects; in other words, the command line interface can be programmed in such way it can be
represented as either *YAML* or *JSON* formats, in addition to a descriptive representation tailored to human actors.

Primitive functions to manipulate the Helm chart should be provided, since most checks involve inspecting the contents
of the chart itself; for example, whether a `README.md` file exists, or whether `README.md` contains the `values`'
specification, implicating in offering a cache API layer is required to avoid downloading and unpacking the charts for
each test.

To verify a chart against all available checks, for exmaple:

```text
> out/chart-verifier verify ./chart.tgz
> out/chart-verifier verify ~/src/chart
> out/chart-verifier verify https://www.example.com/chart.tgz
```

To apply only the `is-helm-v3` check:

```text
> out/chart-verifier verify --enable is-helm-v3 https://www.example.com/chart.tgz
```

To apply all checks except `is-helm-v3`:

```text
> out/chart-verifier verify --disable is-helm-v3 https://www.example.com/chart.tgz
```

### Container Image

The container image produced in 'Building chart-verifier' can then be executed with the Docker client
as `docker run -it --rm quay.io/redhat-certification/chart-verifier:0d3706f verify`.

If you haven't built a container image, you could still use the Docker client to execute the latest release available in
Quay:

```text
> docker run --rm quay.io/redhat-certification/chart-verifier:latest verify --help
Verifies a Helm chart by checking some of its characteristics

Usage:
  chart-verifier verify <chart-uri> [flags]

Flags:
  -S, --chart-set strings          set values for the chart (can specify multiple or separate values with commas: key1=val1,key2=val2)
  -F, --chart-set-file strings     set values from respective files specified via the command line (can specify multiple or separate values with commas: key1=path1,key2=path2)
  -X, --chart-set-string strings   set STRING values for the chart (can specify multiple or separate values with commas: key1=val1,key2=val2)
  -f, --chart-values strings       specify values in a YAML file or a URL (can specify multiple)
  -x, --disable strings            all checks will be enabled except the informed ones
  -e, --enable strings             only the informed checks will be enabled
  -h, --help                       help for verify
  -o, --output string              the output format: default, json or yaml
  -s, --set strings                overrides a configuration, e.g: dummy.ok=false

Global Flags:
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.chart-verifier.yaml)
```

To verify a chart on the host system, the directory containing the chart should be mounted in the container; for http or
https verifications, no mounting is required:

```text
> docker run --rm quay.io/redhat-certification/chart-verifier:latest verify https://github.com/redhat-certification/chart-verifier/blob/main/pkg/chartverifier/checks/chart-0.1.0-v3.valid.tgz?raw=true
```

Here is another example for a chart on the host system using volume mount. In
the below example, the chart is located in the current directory:

```text
> docker run -v $(pwd):/charts --rm quay.io/redhat-certification/chart-verifier:latest verify /charts/chart-0.1.0-v3.valid.tgz
```
