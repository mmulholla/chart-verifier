          "answer": "CockroachDB scales horizontally with minimal operator overhead. You can run it on your local computer, a single server, a corporate development cluster, or a private or public cloud. Adding capacity is as easy as pointing a new node at the running cluster.\n\nAt the key-value level, CockroachDB starts off with a single, empty range. As you put data in, this single range eventually reaches a threshold size (64MB by default). When that happens, the data splits into two ranges, each covering a contiguous segment of the entire key-value space. This process continues indefinitely; as new data flows in, existing ranges continue to split into new ranges, aiming to keep a relatively small and consistent range size.\n\nWhen your cluster spans multiple nodes (physical machines, virtual machines, or containers), newly split ranges are automatically rebalanced to nodes with more capacity. CockroachDB communicates opportunities for rebalancing using a peer-to-peer gossip protocol by which nodes exchange network addresses, store capacity, and other information.",

          "answer": "CockroachDB is designed to survive software and hardware failures, from server restarts to datacenter outages. This is accomplished without confusing artifacts typical of other distributed systems (e.g., stale reads) using strongly-consistent replication as well as automated repair after failures.\n\nReplication\n\nCockroachDB replicates your data for availability and guarantees consistency between replicas using the Raft consensus algorithm, a popular alternative to Paxos. You can define the location of replicas in various ways, depending on the types of failures you want to secure against and your network topology. You can locate replicas on:\n\nDifferent servers within a rack to tolerate server failures\nDifferent servers on different racks within a datacenter to tolerate rack power/network failures\nDifferent servers in different datacenters to tolerate large scale network or power outages\nIn a CockroachDB cluster spread across multiple geographic regions, the round-trip latency between regions will have a direct effect on your database's performance. In such cases, it is important to think about the latency requirements of each table and then use the appropriate data topologies to locate data for optimal performance and resiliency. For a step-by-step demonstration, see Low Latency Multi-Region Deployment.\n\nAutomated Repair\n\nFor short-term failures, such as a server restart, CockroachDB uses Raft to continue seamlessly as long as a majority of replicas remain available. Raft makes sure that a new \u201cleader\u201d for each group of replicas is elected if the former leader fails, so that transactions can continue and affected replicas can rejoin their group once they\u2019re back online. For longer-term failures, such as a server/rack going down for an extended period of time or a datacenter outage, CockroachDB automatically rebalances replicas from the missing nodes, using the unaffected replicas as sources.

A WSDL document defines services as collections of network endpoints (or ports). WSDL is an integral part of UDDI, an XML-based worldwide business registry.\n\nIvory Web services support SOAP bindings only. Two styles of messaging for operations are supported: Document or RPC. Document-oriented messaging implies that messages contain XML documents that represent application data. RPC-oriented messaging implies that messages contain parameters and return values for remote procedure calls.\n\nMessage parts are also affected by the encoding style, which can be either literal or encoded. The most common binding styles are document/literal and RPC/encoded, which are both supported by Ivory. For the document/literal binding style, Ivory uses a subset of the binding style named document/literal wrapped, which wraps the operation name as the top-level element in the message. The document/literal wrapped binding style is WS-I Basic Profile 1.0 compliant.\n\nThe Encoding Style property on the project Start Node specifies which style will be used for that project.",

        "instructions": "Installing Ivory Studio\n\nThe file IvoryStudio.exe starts the install process.\nThe install wizard prompts for the required entries. The license key file (named key.lic) provided by GT Software is needed to complete the Studio installation.\nBe sure to read the specific installation instructions supplied in the readme.txt file.\n\nCaution: Ivory Studio needs to be installed by an Administrator on Windows 7 and above.\n\nInstallation Notes:\n\n\n* Ivory Server is installed separately.\n* The installers are created for and supported under normal Windows environments (real machines), not for virtual machine environments.\n* Administrator privileges are needed to install Studio.\n\nCaution:\n\n\n* When you upgrade Ivory Studio, you should upgrade Ivory Server to the same (or a later) release. An older Ivory Server release may not support all features of the newer Studio release, which may lead to incomplete processing or SOAP faults at server runtime.\n* It is generally best to uninstall any older releases of Studio. Errors are likely to occur if you switch between different releases of Studio when working on a project. The Studio installation wizard does not automatically uninstall an earlier release.\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nIvory Studio\n\n\n* Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP Professional, Server 2012, 2008 R2, 2008, 2003\n* 2 GHz Intel Pentium 4 processor (minimum)\n* 256 MB memory\n* Windows .NET Framework 4.0\n\nWSDL\n\n\n* The WSDL generated by Studio can be processed using Java J2EE, Visual Studio .NET, or any languages or operating systems that support SOAP client processing.\n\nIvory Studio Footprint\nThe Studio executable requires roughly 4 MB of disk space. The total size for the Studio install base with documentation, Studio samples, and executables is about 40 MB. If you install all of the vendor samples, the size will be about 80 MB.\n\nLicense Manager\nThe Ivory Studio License Manager utility provides an easy means to manage the required license key file for Studio.\nThe License Manager is a standalone executable. To run the utility, select Start&gt; Programs&gt; GT_Software&gt; Ivory Studio&gt; Tools&gt; Ivory License Manager.\nThe License Manager displays the details of the license (key.lic) file, including the license expiration date. If there isn't a valid license file in the Program Files/GT_Software/Ivory_Studio/bin folder, the utility displays an error message.\nYou cannot start Studio without a valid license key file in the /bin folder.\n\nCopy the License File Information from an Email\nIf you receive the license key information in an e-mail, you can copy the license information and paste it into the input field at the bottom of the License Manager window. Click Save As to validate the license contents and store the license file. The name defaults to indicate the machine name, such as allusers_key.lic, but can be changed.\nIf you want to use the license file immediately, click Activate to copy it to the /bin folder.\n\nDeploy the License File from a Network Location\nIf the key.lic file isn't found, or if you want to use a different license file, click Browse and navigate to the location where you've saved the license file. The selected file path and name are displayed in the Key File field, and the license details display if the file has a valid format.\nClick Activate to copy that license file into the /bin folder. Studio immediately begins using the new license file.\n\nRegardless of the name used to save the license file, it will be renamed key.lic when it is deployed to the /bin folder.\n\nTrial Users\nIf you are using a trial version of Studio and your 30-day license expires, go to the About screen (Help&gt; About) and click the button to extend the trial period. You will be prompted to enter the trial extension key provided by GT Software."

The username and password defined in the secret will be used to authenticate when using the StorageOS CLI and GUI. Take note of which project you created the secret in.  You may create the secret using the OpenShift UI.\n\n1. \nGo to `Installed Operators` and select the StorageOS operator.\nSelect StorageOS Cluster and create a StorageOS cluster.\n\nThe StorageOS cluster resource describes the StorageOS cluster that will be created. The `secretRefName` and `secretRefNamespace` should reference the secret containing the `apiUsername` and `apiPassword` that was previously created.\n\nFor example:\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">apiVersion: storageos.com/v1kind: StorageOSClustermetadata:  name: storageos  namespace: openshift-operatorsspec:  secretRefName: &quot;storageos-api&quot; # Reference the Secret created in the previous step  secretRefNamespace: &quot;openshift-operators&quot;  # Namespace of the Secret created in the previous step  namespace: kube-system  csi:    enable: true    deploymentStrategy: deployment  resources:    requests:    memory: &quot;512Mi&quot;  k8sDistro: &quot;openshift&quot;`</pre>\n1. \nVerify that the StorageOS Resource enters a running state.\n\n\nIf this is your first installation you may wish to follow the [StorageOS Volume guide](https://docs.storageos.com/docs/platforms/openshift/firstvolume/) for an example of how to mount a StorageOS volume in a Pod.\n\nThe installation instructions are also available with screenshots in the [StorageOS Documentation](https://docs.storageos.com/docs/platforms/openshift/install/4.2)."
